## ðŸ“Œ About This Project

A script built in April 2025 to simulate an HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) result checker. Students enter their roll number once to view their marks from a fixed database, with added validation for roll number length.

## Why I Built This
- To practice dictionary lookups and input validation in Python.  
- To simulate a real-world HSC result-checking website. 

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Takes a roll number as input (expected to be 4 digits).  
- Checks a predefined dictionary for the roll number and displays the marks if found.  
- Returns specific error messages for invalid roll numbers (e.g., more than 4 digits, not in database).  
- Handles non-integer inputs with a clear error message.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using dictionaries for data storage and retrieval.  
- Adding input validation (e.g., checking roll number length).  
- Implementing `try-except` for error handling.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Initial version with dictionary lookup and error handling.  
- âœ… Added validation for 4-digit roll numbers.  

---

## Known Issues
- Crashes on empty inputs
